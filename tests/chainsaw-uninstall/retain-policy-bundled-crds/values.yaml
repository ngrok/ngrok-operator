# Scenario: retain-policy-bundled-crds
# Overrides base values - only specify what's different
#
# - drainPolicy: Retain (default - resources preserved in ngrok API)
# - installCRDs: true (default, bundled with operator)

# drainPolicy defaults to Retain, so we don't need to set it
# But being explicit for clarity:
drainPolicy: Retain
