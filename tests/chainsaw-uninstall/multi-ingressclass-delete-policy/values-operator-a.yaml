# Scenario: multi-ingressclass-delete-policy - Operator A
#
# IMPORTANT: Multi-operator deployments MUST use watchNamespace!
# CloudEndpoints and AgentEndpoints created by the operator driver have NO ingress class
# scoping. If multiple operators watch all namespaces, they will ALL try to reconcile
# each other's driver-generated CRDs, causing conflicts and undefined behavior.
#
# The only supported multi-operator configuration is:
#   - Each operator watches a DIFFERENT namespace (watchNamespace)
#   - Each operator uses a DIFFERENT ingress class (optional, but recommended)

drainPolicy: Delete
installCRDs: false

# REQUIRED for multi-operator: Each operator MUST watch only its own namespace
watchNamespace: namespace-a

ingress:
  controllerName: k8s.ngrok.com/ingress-controller-a
  ingressClass:
    name: ngrok-a
