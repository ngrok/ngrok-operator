- controller-deployment.yaml
# The following included templates are needed due to the way helm unittest works.
# It won't load the temaplates unless they are included here. Due to the checksums
# we are including on the deployment, we need to include them here. It makes the
# snapshot much larger than it needs to be, but it's the only way to test the
# deployment at this time.

- controller-rbac.yaml

tests:
- it: Should match snapshot
