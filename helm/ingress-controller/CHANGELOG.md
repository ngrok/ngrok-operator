# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.13.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/compare/helm-chart-0.12.4...helm-chart-0.13.0

**Important**: If you are upgrading from a previous version and are using `helm install` or `helm upgrade`, you will need to manually apply the changes to the CRDs. This is because the CRDs are not [updated automatically when the chart is updated](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations). To do this, apply the contents of the `crds` directory in the chart to your cluster.

Ex (from the root of the repository):
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./helm/ingress-controller/templates/crds/
```

### Added

- root-cas setting [#371](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/371)
  Takes an install option for `--set rootCAs=host` and plumb the isHostCA check into the caCerts for it to just get the host certs.
- feat: Add support for mutualTLS [#373](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/373)

### Changed

- Update nix flake, go version, and Makefile dep versions [#379](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/379)

## 0.12.4

- Add the `apiURL` value.
  This sets the ngrok API endpoint used by the controller.
  It corresponds to the `--api-url` argument to the manager binary. 

- Update to version 0.10.4 of the ingress controller.
  See its changes [here](../../CHANGELOG.md#0104).

## 0.12.1

- Update to version 0.10.1 of the ingress controller, which includes:
  - IPPolicy controller wasn't applying the attached rules, leaving the IP policy in its current state [#315](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/315)

## 0.12.0

- Update to version 0.10.0 of the ingress controller, this includes:
  - TLSEdge support - see the [TCP and TLS Edges Guide](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/docs/user-guide/tcp-tls-edges.md) for more details.
  - A fix for renegotiating TLS backends

## 0.11.0

** Important ** This version of the controller changes the ownership model for https edge and tunnel CRs. To ease out the transition to the new ownership, make sure to run `migrate-edges.sh` and `migrate-tunnels.sh` scripts before installing the new version.

### Changed
- Specify IPPolicyRule action as an enum of (allow,deny) as part of [#260](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/260)
- Handle special case for changing auth types that causes an error during state transition [#259](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/259)
- Better handling when changing pathType between 'Exact' and 'Prefix' [#262](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/262)
- Update ngrok-go to 1.4.0 [#298](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/298)
- Tunnels are now unique in their respective namespace, not across the cluster [#281](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/281)
- The CRs that ingress controller creates are uniquely marked and managed by it. Other CRs created manually are no longer deleted when the ingress controller is not using them [#267](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/267); fixed for tunnel in [#285](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/285) and for https edges in [#286](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/286)
- Better error handling and retry, specifically for the case where we try to create an https edge for a domain which is not created yet [#283](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/283); fixed in [#288](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/288)
- Watch and apply ngrok module set CR changes [#287](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/287); fixed in [#290](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/290)
- Label https edges and tunnels with service UID to make them more unique within ngrok [#291](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/291); fixed in [#293](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/293) and [#302](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/302)

### Added
- Add support for configuring pod affinities, pod disruption budget, and priorityClassName [#258](https://github.com/ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/258)

### Changed
- Update appVersion to `0.5.0` to match the latest release of the controller.
