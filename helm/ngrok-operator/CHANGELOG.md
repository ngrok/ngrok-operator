### :warning: :warning: :warning: Notice :warning: :warning: :warning:

This release is a release candidate for the upcoming 0.16.0 release. The helm chart has been renamed to `ngrok/ngrok-operator`. Please test this release in a non-production environment before upgrading your production environment. Documentation for migrating from `ngrok/kubernetes-ingress-controller` to `ngrok/ngrok-operator` can be found [here](/docs/deployment-guide/migrating.md).

### Added

#### Kubernetes Operator

The operator installation will now be registered with the ngrok API. This will allow you to view the status of the operator in the ngrok dashboard, see what version of the operator is running, and power new features
in the future. This is powered by a new `KubernetesOperator` CRD that is created by the operator in its
own namespace when it starts up.

- Register operator by @jonstacks in [#457](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/457)
- Add status to KubernetesOperator by @hjkatz in [#467](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/467)

#### Endpoint Bindings (private beta)

Endpoint bindings is a new feature that allows you to securely access a ngrok endpoint no matter where it is running. Specifically, Kubernetes bound endpoints allow you to project services running outside of your Kubernetes cluster or in other clusters into your cluster as native Kubernetes services.

- Add feature flag support for bindings by @hjkatz in [#424](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/424)
- Modify EndpointBinding CRD to reflect cardinality of bound Endpoints by @hjkatz in [#452](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/452)
- Implement AggregateBindingEndpoints for interacting with the ngrok api by @hjkatz in [#453](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/453)
- Implement BindingEndpoint polling by @hjkatz in [#458](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/458)
- Implement EndpointBinding -> Services creation by @hjkatz in [#459](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/459)
- Implement port allocation by @hjkatz in [#460](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/460)
- Bindings forwarder by @jonstacks in [#465](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/465)
- Add endpoint status to EndpointBinding kubectl output by @hjkatz in [#464](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/464)
- Ensure endpoint poller does not start until k8sop is regestered with API by @hjkatz in [#470](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/470)
- Rename EndpointBinding to BoundEndpoint by @hjkatz in [#475](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/475)
- Implement Target Metadata by @hjkatz in [#477](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/477)
- Bindings forwarder implementation by @jonstacks in [#476](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/476)

#### Helm values.yaml schema validation

The `ngrok-operator` helm chart now includes a `schema.json` file that can be used to validate the `values.yaml` file.

- Generate and commit schema.json file by @alex-bezek in [#472](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/472)

### Changed

#### Traffic Policy

Updates `TrafficPolicy` CRD and inline policy to support new phase-based names as well as the new `TrafficPolicy` API.

- update traffic policy for phase-based naming by @TheConcierge in [#456](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/456)

#### Values.yaml file deprecations

- Rename .Values.metaData -> .Values.ngrokMetadata by @hjkatz in [#434](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/434).
  - Deprecate `.Values.metaData` in favor of `.Values.ngrokMetadata` for clarity
  - Deprecate `.Values.ingressClass` in favor of `.Values.ingress.ingressClass` for feature set namespacing
  - Deprecate `.Values.useExperimentalGatewayApi` in favor of `.Values.gateway.enabled` for feature set namespacing
  - Deprecate `.Values.watchNamespace` in favor of `.Values.ingress.watchNamespace` for feature set namespacing
  - Deprecate `.Values.controllerName` in favor of `.Values.ingress.controllerName` for feature set namespacing

### New Contributors
- @TheConcierge made their first contribution in [#456](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/456)

## 0.13.0

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/compare/helm-chart-0.12.4...helm-chart-0.13.0

**Important**: If you are upgrading from a previous version and are using `helm install` or `helm upgrade`, you will need to manually apply the changes to the CRDs. This is because the CRDs are not [updated automatically when the chart is updated](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations). To do this, apply the contents of the `crds` directory in the chart to your cluster.

Ex (from the root of the repository):
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./helm/ingress-controller/templates/crds/
```

### Added

- root-cas setting [#371](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/371)
  Takes an install option for `--set rootCAs=host` and plumb the isHostCA check into the caCerts for it to just get the host certs.
- feat: Add support for mutualTLS [#373](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/373)

### Changed

- Update nix flake, go version, and Makefile dep versions [#379](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/379)

## 0.12.4

- Add the `apiURL` value.
  This sets the ngrok API endpoint used by the controller.
  It corresponds to the `--api-url` argument to the manager binary.

- Update to version 0.10.4 of the ingress controller.
  See its changes [here](../../CHANGELOG.md#0104).

## 0.12.1

- Update to version 0.10.1 of the ingress controller, which includes:
  - IPPolicy controller wasn't applying the attached rules, leaving the IP policy in its current state [#315](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/315)

## 0.12.0

- Update to version 0.10.0 of the ingress controller, this includes:
  - TLSEdge support - see the [TCP and TLS Edges Guide](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/blob/main/docs/user-guide/tcp-tls-edges.md) for more details.
  - A fix for renegotiating TLS backends

## 0.11.0

** Important ** This version of the controller changes the ownership model for https edge and tunnel CRs. To ease out the transition to the new ownership, make sure to run `migrate-edges.sh` and `migrate-tunnels.sh` scripts before installing the new version.

### Changed
- Specify IPPolicyRule action as an enum of (allow,deny) as part of [#260](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/260)

- Better handling when changing pathType between 'Exact' and 'Prefix' [#262](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/262)
- Update ngrok-go to 1.4.0 [#298](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/298)
- Tunnels are now unique in their respective namespace, not across the cluster [#281](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/281)
- The CRs that ingress controller creates are uniquely marked and managed by it. Other CRs created manually are no longer deleted when the ingress controller is not using them [#267](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/issues/267); fixed for tunnel in [#285](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/285) and for https edges in [#286](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/286)
- Better error handling and retry, specifically for the case where we try to create an https edge for a domain which is not created yet [#283](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/issues/283); fixed in [#288](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/288)
- Watch and apply ngrok module set CR changes [#287](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/issues/287); fixed in [#290](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-operator/pull/290)
