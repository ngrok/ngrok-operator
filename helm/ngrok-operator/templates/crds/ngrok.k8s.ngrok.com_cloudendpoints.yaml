                  in the pool. A URL can only be shared across multiple Cloud Endpoints if they all have pooling enabled.

                  The unique URL for this cloud endpoint. This URL is the public address. The following formats are accepted
                  Domain - example.org
                      When using the domain format you are only defining the domain. The scheme and port will be inferred.
                  Origin - https://example.ngrok.app or https://example.ngrok.app:443 or tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 or tls://example.ngrok.app
                      When using the origin format you are defining the protocol, domain and port. HTTP endpoints accept ports 80 or 443 with respective protocol.
                  Scheme (shorthand) - https:// or tcp:// or tls:// or http://
                      When using scheme you are defining the protocol and will receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Empty - ``
                      When empty your endpoint will default to be https and receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Internal - some.domain.internal
                      When ending your url with .internal, an internal endpoint will be created. nternal Endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather
                      can only be accessed using the forward-internal traffic policy action.
