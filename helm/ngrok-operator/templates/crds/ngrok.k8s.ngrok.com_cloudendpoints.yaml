                  Domain - example.org
                      When using the domain format you are only defining the domain. The scheme and port will be inferred.
                  Origin - https://example.ngrok.app or https://example.ngrok.app:443 or tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 or tls://example.ngrok.app
                      When using the origin format you are defining the protocol, domain and port. HTTP endpoints accept ports 80 or 443 with respective protocol.
                  Scheme (shorthand) - https:// or tcp:// or tls:// or http://
                      When using scheme you are defining the protocol and will receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Empty - ``
                      When empty your endpoint will default to be https and receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Internal - some.domain.internal
                      When ending your url with .internal, an internal endpoint will be created. nternal Endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather
                      can only be accessed using the forward-internal traffic policy action.
