                      Origin - https://example.org or http://example.org:80 or tcp://127.0.0.1:80
                          When using the origin format you are defining the protocol, domain and port.
                              When no port is present and scheme is https or http the port will be inferred.
                                  For https port will be443.
                                  For http port will be 80.
                      Domain - example.org
                          This is only allowed for https and http endpoints.
                              For tcp and tls endpoints host and port is required.
                          When using the domain format you are only defining the host.
                              Scheme will default to http.
                              Port will default to 80.
                      Scheme (shorthand) - https://
                          This only works for https and http.
                              For tcp and tls host and port is required.
                          When using scheme you are defining the protocol and the port will be inferred on the local host.
                              For https port will be443.
                              For http port will be 80.
                              Host will be localhost.
                      Port (shorthand) - 8080
                          When using port you are defining the port on the local host that will receive traffic.
                              Scheme will default to http.
                              Host will default to localhost.

                  The unique URL for this agent endpoint. This URL is the public address. The following formats are accepted
                  Domain - example.org
                      When using the domain format you are only defining the domain. The scheme and port will be inferred.
                  Origin - https://example.ngrok.app or https://example.ngrok.app:443 or tcp://1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 or tls://example.ngrok.app
                      When using the origin format you are defining the protocol, domain and port. HTTP endpoints accept ports 80 or 443 with respective protocol.
                  Scheme (shorthand) - https:// or tcp:// or tls:// or http://
                      When using scheme you are defining the protocol and will receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Empty - ``
                      When empty your endpoint will default to be https and receive back a randomly assigned ngrok address.
                  Internal - some.domain.internal
                      When ending your url with .internal, an internal endpoint will be created. nternal Endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather
                      can only be accessed using the forward-internal traffic policy action.
