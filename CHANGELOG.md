## 0.10.4

### Added

- Add the `--api-url` option

  It can be set through via the helm `apiURL` value.

- Add gateway to client info comment

### Changed

- Controller will now start without having session established. Any operations
  that require tunnels will return error, while it is trying to create a session.
  Its ready and health checks now depend on the status of this session - `ready`
  will not return `ok` until connection was established, and `health` check will
  return error if this connection had authentication issues.
