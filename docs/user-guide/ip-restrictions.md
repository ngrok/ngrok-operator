# IP Restrictions

ngrok offers the ability to restrict access to your edges by IP address via [IP Restrictions](https://ngrok.com/docs/http/ip-restrictions/).
These are configurable via the [IPPolicy](./crds.md#ip-policies) CRD and can be attached to Ingress objects via [NgrokModuleSet](./route-modules.md).
