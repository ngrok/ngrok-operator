# CRDs

Kubernetes has the concept of [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) (CRDs) which allow you to define your own custom resources. This document will cover the CRDs you might use to achieve your goals with the ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller.

_**Warning:**_  There are other CRDs not documented here that are used internally by the controller. It is not recommended to edit these, but inspecting them to query the state of the system could be useful at times. See the [internal CRDs](../developer-guide/internal-crds.md) document for more details.

## Ngrok Module Sets

`NgrokModuleSets` is a CRD that lets you define combinations of ngrok modules that can be set on your ingress objects and applied to all of their routes. For an in-depth guide on configuring `NgrokModuleSets` see the [Route Modules Guide](./route-modules.md).

### NgrokModuleSetModules

| `ipRestriction` | EndpointIPPolicy | Configuration for IP restriction for this module |
| `tlsTermination` | EndpointTLSTerminationAtEdge | Configuration for TLS termination for this module |
| `webhookVerification` | EndpointWebhookVerification | Configuration for webhook verification for this module |

### NgrokModuleSet

| Field | Type | Description |

| `provider` | string | String indicating which webhook provider will be sending webhooks to this endpoint |

## IP Policies

The `IPPolicy` CRD manages the ngrok [API resource](https://ngrok.com/docs/api/resources/ip-policies) directly. It is a first class CRD that you can manage to control these policies in your account.

It's optional to create IP Policies this way vs using the ngrok dashboard or [terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ngrok/ngrok/latest/docs/resources/ip_policy). Once created though, you can use it in your ingress objects using the [annotations](./annotations.md#ip-restriction).

| Field | Description | Required | Type | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | ------- |
| metadata | Standard object metadata | No | [metav1.ObjectMeta](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#ObjectMeta) | `name: my-ip-policy` |
| spec.ngrokAPICommon | Fields shared across all ngrok resources | Yes | [ngrokAPICommon](#ngrokapicommon) | `{}` |
| spec.rules | A list of rules that belong to the policy | No | `[]IPPolicyRule` | `[{CIDR: "1.2.3.4", Action: "allow"}]` |
| status.ID | The unique identifier for this policy | No | `string` | `"my-ip-policy-id"` |
| status.Rules | A list of IP policy rules and their status | No | `[]IPPolicyRuleStatus` | `[{ID: "my-rule-id", CIDR: "1.2.3.4", Action: "allow"}]` |

### `IPPolicyRule`
| Field | Description | Required | Type | Example |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | ------- |

## TCP Edges

The Kubernetes ingress spec does not directly support TCP traffic. The ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller supports TCP traffic via the [TCP Edge](https://ngrok.com/docs/api#tcp-edge) resource. This is a first class CRD that you can manage to control these edges in your account. This is in progress and not yet fully supported. Check back soon for updates to the [TCP Edge Guide](./tcp-edge.md).
